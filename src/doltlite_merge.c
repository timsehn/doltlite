/*
** Three-way catalog merge with conflict detection for Doltlite.
**
** Given three catalog hashes (ancestor, ours, theirs), produce a merged
** catalog. For each table:
**   - If only one side changed it, take that side's root hash.
**   - If both sides changed the same table, return SQLITE_ERROR (conflict).
**   - If a table was added on one side and doesn't exist on the other, include it.
**   - If deleted on one side and unchanged on the other, delete it.
**
** Returns the merged catalog as a serialized chunk stored in the chunk store.
